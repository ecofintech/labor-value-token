*Labor Value Token

Labour-Value token (LABOR) is a mutual debt and credit token through which we account for the loans given to support the project and use it as payment method for internal cooperative tasks. LABOR allows participation in the DACoop governance structure
and decision making, which is reserved for stakeholders and workers of the cooperative.
It is inspired by the classical theory of political economy and mutualist associations’
practices (taken with a pinch of salt) and has a double purpose: it is used as a system of
internal debt accounting and as a means to educate participants contributing work to
use tokens and crypto-economic resources building internal circular econoomy.

**Tokenomics

Ecofintech Coop issues a virtualization of social capital equivalent to the work done or
sponsorship loans received. Each Labour-Value Token (LABOR) is equivalent to three hours
of work or "three-twelve pounds of corn", which can be capitalised through an internal
exchange using a common fund of the cooperative or cryptocurrency exchanges.
Labour within Ecofintech Coop is divided into three categories:
-Labour for the common good.
-Subsistence labour.
-Reproductive and care labour. 

Participants in the ecosystem can self-initiate and carry out tasks that contribute to
the common good on a voluntary basis and thus also enable the project to grow, for
which they receive internal payments in LABOR.
The subsistence labour is crucial for the development of the economic activities of the
cooperative, and is also remunerated using LABOR token.
The cooperative’s common funds are to be used for exchanges to the participants who receive labour-value token and require cash to cover subsistence and
investment expenses:

-75% intended for exchanges of Tokens earned for subsistence labour
-25% intended for exchanges of Tokens earned for labour for common good
